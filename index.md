I'm an ITC Fellow at the
[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](http://cfa.harvard.edu).
Until recently, I was a grad student in the
[astronomy department](http://astro.berkeley.edu) at
[UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu).  For my thesis, I worked with
Professor [Eliot Quataert](http://astro.berkeley.edu/~eliot), studying
the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters.

I did my undergraduate studies at
[Stanford University](http://www.stanford.edu), where I majored in
physics with a concentration in theoretical physics.  My research
there focused on modeling gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters.

I was born in Seattle, Washington and grew up in Santa Monica,
California.  When not in my office, I enjoy hiking, skiing,
woodworking, growing tomatoes, traveling, and
[photography](https://picasaweb.google.com/112418946734251241705),
among other things.

Feel free to stop by my desk or otherwise
[contact me]({{site.url}}/contact/index.html) via your preferred
method.
