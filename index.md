I’m a data scientist, researcher, and co-founder of [Sturdy
Statistics](https://sturdystatistics.com), where we help organizations
unlock insight from unstructured data using practical AI tools that
are deeply grounded in statistics.  Before starting the company, I
spent seven years at [Invoca](https://www.invoca.com) as their Senior
Principal Data Scientist, where I led development of production AI
systems, along with the creation of several patents in explainable
machine learning.

Earlier in my career, I was a researcher in astrophysics, holding
fellowships at
[Harvard](https://pweb.cfa.harvard.edu/opportunities/fellowships-visiting-scientist-positions/itc-fellowship),
[NASA](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program),
and the [Kavli Institute for Theoretical
Physics](https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/apply/fellowships/graduate-fellowship-program)
as well as a postdoc at [UC Santa
Barbara](http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~astrogroup/).  I earned my
Ph.D. in Astrophysics from [UC Berkeley](https://astro.berkeley.edu),
where I studied galaxy clusters and plasma physics with Professor
[Eliot Quataert](https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~quataert/).  As an
undergrad at Stanford, I majored in physics with a concentration in
theoretical physics and performed research on gravitational lensing
under Professor [Roger
Blandford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Blandford).

These days I split my time between Sturdy Statistics and starting a
family.  I still enjoy hiking, woodworking, gardening, and
[photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mkmccjr/albums/), when I
get the chance.

Feel free to reach out or [get in
touch]({{site.url}}/contact).  I’m always happy to connect.
