I’m a data scientist, researcher, and co-founder of [Sturdy
Statistics](https://sturdystatistics.com), where we help organizations
turn unstructured data into insight using practical, statistically
grounded AI tools.  Before starting the company with [Kian
Ghodoussi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kian-ghodoussi/), I spent seven
years at [Invoca](https://www.invoca.com) as their Senior Principal
Data Scientist, where I led the development of production AI systems
and authored several patents in explainable machine learning.

Earlier in my career, I was a researcher in astrophysics, holding
fellowships at
[Harvard](https://pweb.cfa.harvard.edu/opportunities/fellowships-visiting-scientist-positions/itc-fellowship),
[NASA](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program),
and the [Kavli Institute for Theoretical
Physics](https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/apply/fellowships/graduate-fellowship-program)
as well as a postdoc at [UC Santa
Barbara](http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~astrogroup/).  I earned my
Ph.D. in Astrophysics as a <a href="#footnotes"
aria-describedby="footnote-label"
id="footnotes-ref"><i>BADGrad</i></a> from [UC
Berkeley](https://astro.berkeley.edu), where I studied galaxy clusters
and plasma physics with Professor [Eliot
Quataert](https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~quataert/).  As an
undergrad at Stanford, I majored in physics with a concentration in
theoretical physics and performed research on gravitational lensing
under Professor [Roger
Blandford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Blandford).

These days I split my time between Sturdy Statistics and raising a
family.  When I get the chance, I enjoy hiking, woodworking,
gardening, and
[photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mkmccjr/albums/).

Interested in my [astrophysics research](/research), [AI
patents](/patents), [software tools](/software), or
[talks](/research/talks)? You can also browse my [figure
gallery](/figure-gallery), [posters](/posters), [CV](/CV), or
