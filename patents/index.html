<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The patents listed below reflect my effort to advance machine learning
methods that are both statistically principled and practically
effective.  Much of this work centers on the development and
application of non-parametric Bayesian models &mdash; particularly the
Hierarchical Pitman-Yor Process (HPYP) &mdash; to extract structure
from complex, sparse, and noisy data sources such as call transcripts,
electronic documents, and genomic sequences.
</p>

<p>
Several of these inventions introduce novel ways to incorporate domain
knowledge into probabilistic models through mixture priors, enabling
faster training, better generalization, and greater interpretability
&mdash; especially in low-data regimes.  Others address key challenges
in robust classification, such as label noise and model calibration,
with solutions tailored for high-stakes or resource-constrained
environments.  The importance of sparse representations and
identifiable features for interpretability, trustworthiness, and
generalization is another consistent theme of my work.
</p>

<p>
Together, these patents lay the groundwork for scalable, interpretable
AI systems that retain statistical rigor while adapting flexibly to
the needs of real-world applications.  They represent both theoretical
innovation and applied insight across fields as diverse as natural
language processing, semantic search, and biomedical signal detection.
