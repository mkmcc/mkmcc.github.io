Of course, I should to give credit where it is due.  This site uses
the [Gentium](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Gentium+Basic),
[Patua One](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Patua+One),
[Inconsolata](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Inconsolata),
and [Pompiere](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Pompiere)
typefaces hosted by the free [Google
WebFonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts#HomePlace:home) service.

I wrote the most of the css for this site myself, but used this
["normalize.css"](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and [this
guy's](http://alexpeattie.com/blog/github-style-syntax-highlighting-with-pygments/)
css file for syntax highlighting.  The rest was heavily inspired by
[Emmanuel Beffara's](http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~beffara/) website and
bears an obvious resemblance.  The colors are taken from the
[solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) palette by Ethan
Schoonover.

This website is hosted by the awesome [github
pages](https://pages.github.com/) project, which was interesting
enough to convert me from using org-mode and emacs to generate the
html pages to using markdown and jekyll.

If you're interested, you can view the source for this website on

and adapt anything you like.
