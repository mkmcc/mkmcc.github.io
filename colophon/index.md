I should to give credit where it is due.  This site uses the
[Gentium](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Gentium+Basic),
[Patua One](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Patua+One),
[Inconsolata](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Inconsolata),
and [Pompiere](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Pompiere)
typefaces hosted by the free
[Google WebFonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts#HomePlace:home)
service.

I wrote the most of the css for this site myself, but used this
["normalize.css"](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and
[this guy's](http://alexpeattie.com/blog/github-style-syntax-highlighting-with-pygments/)
css file for syntax highlighting.  The rest was heavily inspired by
[Emmanuel Beffara's](http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~beffara/) website and
bears an obvious resemblance.  I took colors from the
[solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) palette by Ethan
Schoonover.

This website is hosted by the awesome
[github pages](https://pages.github.com/) project, which was
interesting enough to convert me from using org-mode and emacs to
generate the html pages to using newfangled things like markdown,
yaml, and jekyll.  If you're interested, you can view the source for
this website on [github](https://github.com/mkmcc/mkmcc.github.io).
Feel free to copy and adapt anything you like.

I made all of the figures and plots on this site (and in my papers)
using the wonderful [tioga](https://rubygems.org/gems/tioga) library.
Not only is it the best plotting program I've ever used, but it's
named after Tioga pass in California.  It would be unthinkable not to
use it.
