In addition to my research and commercial software, I occasionally get
to work on fun (if somewhat idiosyncratic) open source projects.  As
an undergrad I wrote [gnuplot mode](./gnuplot-mode.html), an Emacs
major mode for editing and running gnuplot files.  In grad school I
wrote [bibslurp](./bibslurp.html), a Emacs tool to automatically
import bibtex entries from NASA ADS into your LaTeX project.  The code
is a bit complex. I wrote it before ADS had an API â€” or at least
before I knew one existed.  And I also wrote
[Jumblr](https://github.com/mkmcc/jumblr), a word game that runs in
Emacs.  You can find these mode at MELPA using the following links:
* [Gnuplot-Mode](https://melpa.org/#/gnuplot-mode) (over 32,000 downloads)
* [BibSlurp](https://melpa.org/#/bibslurp) (almost 2,000 downloads)
* [Jumblr](https://melpa.org/#/jumblr) (over 2,000 downloads)

While learning how to write massively parallel C-code for
supercomputers using MPI, I wrote a [parallel
renderer](https://mikemccourt.com/fractal-mpi/) for Julia sets and
[another one](http://mikemccourt.com/strange-attractor/) for strange
attractors.  You can see some of the resulting images <a

And if you're the kind of person who would buy an automatic watch,
then immediately look for tools to disassemble and adjust it, you
might be interested in a small
[program](https://github.com/mkmcc/watch-calibration) I wrote to
accurately estimate ticking frequency from sound recordings.
