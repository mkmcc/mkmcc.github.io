In the course of my work, I end up writing a lot of software.
Whenever I write something which others may find useful, I\'ll try to
post it here.

On this page I link to my
[gnuplot mode for emacs](./gnuplot-mode.html),
[a function to import ADS bibtex entries into emacs](./bibslurp.html),
and [my github page](https://www.github.com/mkmcc/), which includes
some fun projects not related to my research (including
[Jumblr](https://github.com/mkmcc/jumblr), a word game that runs in
emacs).  If you're the kind of person who would buy a watch, then
immediately look for tools to disassemble and adjust it, you might be
interested in a small
[program](https://github.com/mkmcc/watch-calibration) I wrote to
accurately estimate ticking frequency from sound recordings.
