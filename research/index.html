Galaxy clusters are filled with a hot, magnetized plasma that&rsquo;s
surprisingly thermally conductive.  This makes the gas susceptible to
two recently-discovered instabilities known as the HBI and the MTI
(pictured to the left). These instabilities are a lot like normal
convection, but they depend on <i>temperature</i> instead
of <i>entropy</i>.  The gas in galaxy clusters is stable to the
classical theory for convection, but <i>unstable</i> to these new
instabilities.</p>

<p>Why&rsquo;s this interesting? Clusters have long been assumed to be
convectively stable, but it now seems that the intracluster plasma
boils vigorously.  This boiling represents a radical change in the
dynamics of cluster gas, and could affect the way we interpret
observations of galaxy clusters.  Convection efficiently mixes the gas
and would distribute metals more efficiently through the cluster.
Boiling also drives turbulence, which influences the connection
between gas pressure and gravity used to infer the masses of clusters.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve worked on understanding the differences between the HBI and
the MTI, and on understanding their non-linear saturation.  Since the
linear phases are so short-lived, understanding the non-linear
behavior of the instabilities is essential for knowing their
astrophysical implications.
</p>

<h4> The HBI: an instability seeking stability </h4>
<p>
The HBI, pictured below, turns out to be a fairly quiescent
instability.  As the instability grows, it reorients magnetic field
lines to be preferentially horizontal.  This <i>stabilizes</i> the gas
against the HBI, so the instability effectively shuts itself off
before it really develops.  We end up with a stable atmosphere,
without much turbulence, and with very horizontal magnetic field
lines.  This happens when the temperature increases with radius, as in
the centers of cool-core galaxy clusters.
</p>

<h4> The MTI: boiling away </h4>
<p>
The MTI occurs in the outer parts of galaxy clusters, where the
temperature declines with radius.  In many ways, this instability is
similar to the HBI: it creates buoyant plumes which rake out the
magnetic field lines, reorienting an initially horizontal field to
become predominantly vertical.  This is where the similarity with the
HBI stops, however: while vertical field lines are linearly stable to
the MTI, they are <i>non-linearly unstable</i> (i.e., they become
unstable if given a big enough push).  So the MTI can&rsquo;t shut
itself off as efficiently as the HBI; it continues to grow and can
eventually drive vigorous convection.

<h4> What&rsquo;s next? </h4>
<p>
The simulations depicted above are idealized and are only
intended highlight the basic physics of these new forms of convection.
I&rsquo;m currently working on a method to study the instabilities in a
more realistic environment resembling a forming galaxy cluster.  I&rsquo;ve
included a figure from a preliminary simulation below.  This is a work in progress... stay tuned!

<h4>Using G2 to probe the galactic center accretion flow</h4>

<p>
A magnetically-enhanced drag force is very interesting, because
there&rsquo;s potentially a detection of a drag force on G2&rsquo;s
orbit!
How to motivate the next project without going into too much detail?
</p>

<p>
The figure below shows a perspective rendering of the best model I
found.  I rotated the coordinate system so that G2 originates at
apocenter along the <i>x</i>-axis and that the rotation axis of the
accretion flow is in the <i>x-z</i> plane.  This more clearly shows
the rotation of the cloud&rsquo;s orbital plane.
</p>

<a href="{{site.url}}/figures/3d-array.pdf">
<img src="{{site.url}}/figures/3d-array.png"
     alt="hbi nonlinear evolution"
     width="550"
     height="137"
     style="background:white;border:5px solid #eee8d5;"
     class="pad center">
</a>

<p>
The gas cloud comes in from apocenter on a nearly radial orbit.  The
cloud&rsquo;s orbital plane is misaligned with the rotation of the
background flow; this results in a perpendicular component to the drag
force.  As the cloud approaches the black hole, the perpendicular drag
force increases due to both the increasing background density and the
increasing rotation velocity.  The resulting torque rapidly re-orients
the orbital plane.  After about five pericenter passages, the orbital
plane is aligned with the rotation axis of the accretion flow.  No
further rotation occurs, but the orbit circularizes and the cloud
becomes approximately co-moving with the rotating gas.  The drag force
thus drops significantly; the cloud slowly sinks in toward the black
hole.  Of course, after many pericenter passages, the cloud may be
tidally distorted to the point where it intersects itself; this
process could lead to much more rapid circularization and inflow, but
is not accounted for in our calculation.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ll admit that the orbit above looks slightly crazy, so I want
to emphasize that it <i>is</i> in fact consistent with the
observations.  The plot below shows the trajectory of the cloud in the
plane of the sky, along with the astrometric measurements for G1 and
G2.  I also show the line-of-sight velocities determined from
spectroscopy of the Br-Î³ line.  <i>This model does just as well as
fitting the G1 and G2 with two unrelated Keplerian orbits.</i>

</a>

<p>
My long-term goal is to be able to do something useful with this type
of analysis.  Below I show probability distributions for six
parameters in the model: the angular coordinates for the rotation axis
of the accretion flow, the magnetic field strength and density profile
for the gas in the galactic center, the shape of the cloud, and the
rotation profile for the galactic center.  Already, this constrains
the rotation axis quite closely.  The other parameters are strongly
degenerate; the magnetic field strength and the density profile both
control the magnitude of the drag force, and the cloud doesn&rsquo;t
really care where it came from.  This does mean that measuring the
magnetic field strength would yield a constraint on the density
profile, however.  Similarly, measuring the shape of the cloud would
yield a constraint on the rotation profile for the galactic center
accretion flow &mdash; both are very exciting prospects!

<h2 id="sec:ti">Cold Gas in Hot Halos</h2>
<div class="section">

<p>
Remarkably, some galaxy clusters contain thin filaments of cold
(10<sup>4</sup> K) gas embedded right within the hot (10<sup>8</sup>
K) plasma.  Below, the beautiful optical and x-ray images
from <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.418.2154F">Fabian
et al. (2011)</a> show the co-existence of these two phases of gas.

<p>
I&rsquo;ve studied thermal instability in galaxy
clusters and argued that it can produce filaments of cold gas like the
ones observed.  Whether or not the plasma in clusters is thermally
unstable is a surprisingly tricky question --- it depends on the
unknown &ldquo;feedback&rdquo; process heating the plasma, which is
extremely difficult to model in detail and is still a very active
field of research.  My approach was to <i>assume</i> that the gas is
thermally unstable, then to see what other testable implications that
would have for the gas in galaxy clusters.
</p>

<h4> When do we get cold gas? </h4>
<p>
Even though I assumed that <i>all</i> of the plasma in <i>every</i>
cluster is thermally unstable, it turns out that the instability only
grows to large amplitudes at special locations in the cluster.  We
should only expect to see cold gas develop at locations where the
cooling time drops below the free-fall (or dynamical) time.  The plot
below shows this result for various assumptions about the gas.  In all
cases, we only see clumps or filaments of cold gas when the cooling
time is shorter than the free-fall time.

Though this result depends on the non-linear saturation of the thermal
instability, we got lucky and it&rsquo;s surprisingly simple to
understand.  The plot to the right tracks the growth of the
instability in my simulations.  Perturbations initially grow
exponentially, which is not surprising since I put in an instability
by hand.  (The slower growth for the red curve happens because the
instability switches to an overstability in that limit.)  The
exponential growth can&rsquo;t continue forever, however; it stops
when the damping rate due to internal gravity wave turbulence matches
the driving rate due to thermal instability.  This balance picks out a
final amplitude Î´Ï/Ï~(t<sub>cool</sub>/t<sub>ff</sub>)<sup>-1</sup>.
Multi-phase gas requires Î´Ï/Ï>1, which explains why we only see it
when t<sub>cool</sub> drops below t<sub>ff</sub>.
</p>

<h4> What can thermal instability do for you? </h4>
<p>
The figure below plots the ratio t<sub>cool</sub>/t<sub>ff</sub> as a
function of radius in a handful of galaxy clusters.  The ones shown in
blue are clusters which are known to have filaments of cold gas, while
the ones shown in red are known <i>not</i> to contain filaments.
There does seem to be a threshold in t<sub>cool</sub>/t<sub>ff</sub>
separating the clusters with and without multiphase gas.
Interestingly, the curves all reach a minimum at a few tens of
kiloparsecs; this is exactly where we see cold gas seen in many
clusters!

<h2 id="sec:outer-parts">Why Aren&rsquo;t Galaxy Clusters Isothermal?</h2>
<div class="section">

<p>
Somehow, galaxy clusters maintain their large-scale temperature
gradients in spite of thermal conduction and convection.  Conduction
and convection are enemies of temperature differences... they should
only take a few billion years (less than the age of a typical cluster)
to equilibrate and make the gas isothermal.  But for some reason,
clusters aren&rsquo;t becoming isothermal.  Since the convective
stability of cluster gas depends on its temperature profile, I became
very interested in this conundrum.
</p>

</a>
I put together a simple model for the formation of galaxy clusters in
which the cluster assembles &ldquo;shell-by-shell.&rdquo; Each shell
falls in a little faster than the last, and thus shocks to a higher
entropy.  Hydrostatic equilibrium then determines the temperature
profile, which depends directly on the accretion rate of the cluster.
The accretion rates typical for galaxy clusters turn out to yield
declining temperature profiles, similar to what are observed.
Measuring the properties of the gas in clusters may thus provide an
interesting indirect measurement of the formation histories of
clusters.
</p>

<p>
This model neatly reproduces the observed temperature profiles of
galaxy clusters, but what about conduction and convection?  Why
don&rsquo;t they wash out the temperature differences and make the gas
isothermal?  Conduction does indeed move thermal energy outwards in
galaxy clusters.  But, rather than heating the gas in the outskirts up
to higher temperatures, the influx of thermal energy <i>expands</i> the gas
&mdash; this pushes the shock further out and causes the temperature
to actually go down!
</p>

<h4>What's next?</h4>

<p>
This method provides an inexpensive way to model the temperature
profile of a galaxy cluster given its accretion history.  Since the
scatter in accretion histories is well-known from cosmological
simulations of structure formation, I outlined a method for using the
(known) scatter in accretion histories to predict the (unknown)
scatter in cluster observables at fixed mass.  For example, the figure
below shows that variation in accretion histories leads to about a 10%
scatter in temperature at fixed mass.  My collaborators and I are
currently using this method to better understand potential biases in
some cosmological measurements.

<h2 id="sec:bent-lobes">Spitting into the Wind</h2>
<div class="section">

<p>
The filaments I mentioned <a href="#sec:ti">above</a> are a lot like
star-forming clouds, but they don&rsquo;t live in galaxies.  Some
friends and I submitted an observing proposal to study star formation
in these filaments and compare it to star formation in molecular
clouds in galaxies.  While writing that proposal, we serendipitously
discovered a bent radio jet in one of the galaxies in the Perseus
cluster, pictured below.
</p>

<img src="{{site.url}}/figures/bent-lobes.png"
     alt="hbi nonlinear evolution"
     width="550"
     height="auto"
     class="pad center">

<p>
The jet is a beam of energetic particles launched by the super-massive
black hole in the center of the galaxy.  In this galaxy, the jet is
being bent backwards by the headwind the galaxy feels as it flies
through the plasma filling the galaxy cluster in which it lives.
</p>

<p>
We weren&rsquo;t the first to observe this phenomenon; in fact,
it&rsquo;s so well known that it&rsquo;s been used to discover new
galaxy clusters in radio surveys.  <i>However</i>, our
galaxy <i>is</i> the most extreme one known to date.  This jet&rsquo;s
bending is so severe that its radius of curvature is much
smaller than the size of the galaxy.  This implies that the
&ldquo;wind&rdquo; of intracluster plasma penetrates so deep into the
center of the galaxy that it affects star formation in the galaxy and
even the dynamics of its central black hole!  The galaxy is totally changed due to the fact that it&rsquo;s inside a galaxy
cluster.
</p>

<p>
Because we know how strong a headwind this galaxy feels, we can model
the dynamics of the jet in a little bit of detail.  We found that the
standard assumption of equipartition often used in interpreting other
jets underestimates the pressure in this one by a factor of almost 30.
