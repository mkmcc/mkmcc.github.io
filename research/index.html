Galaxy clusters are filled with a hot, magnetized plasma that&rsquo;s
surprisingly thermally conductive.  This makes the gas susceptible to
two recently-discovered instabilities known as the HBI and the MTI
(pictured to the left). These instabilities are a lot like normal
convection, but they depend on <i>temperature</i> instead
of <i>entropy</i>.  It turns out that the gas in galaxy clusters is
stable to the classical theory for convection, but <i>unstable</i> to
these new instabilities.
</p>

<p>
Why&rsquo;s this interesting? Clusters have long been assumed to be
convectively stable, but it now seems that the intracluster plasma
boils vigorously.  This boiling represents a radical change in the
dynamics of cluster gas, and could affect the way we interpret
observations of galaxy clusters.  Convection efficiently mixes the gas
and would distribute metals more efficiently through the cluster.
Boiling also drives turbulence, which influences the connection
between gas pressure and gravity used to infer the masses of clusters,
and thus to constrain things like dark energy.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.413.1295M">I&rsquo;ve
worked</a> on understanding the differences between the HBI and the
MTI, and on understanding their non-linear saturation.  Since the
linear phases are so short-lived, understanding the non-linear
behavior of the instabilities is essential for knowing their
astrophysical implications.
</p>

<h4> The HBI: an instability seeking stability </h4>
<p>
The HBI, pictured below, turns out to be a fairly quiescent
instability.  As the instability grows, it reorients magnetic field
lines to be preferentially horizontal.  This <i>stabilizes</i> the gas
against the HBI, so the instability effectively shuts itself off
before it really develops.  We end up with a stable atmosphere,
without much turbulence, and with very horizontal magnetic field
lines.  This happens when the temperature increases with radius, as in
the centers of cool-core galaxy clusters.

</a>

<h4> The MTI: boiling away </h4>
<p>
The MTI occurs in the outer parts of galaxy clusters, where the
temperature declines with radius.  In many ways, this instability is
similar to the HBI: it creates buoyant plumes which rake out the
magnetic field lines, reorienting an initially horizontal field to
become predominantly vertical.  This is where the similarity with the
HBI stops, however: while vertical field lines are linearly stable to
the MTI, they are <i>non-linearly unstable</i> (i.e., they become
unstable if given a big enough push).  So the MTI can&rsquo;t shut
itself off as efficiently as the HBI; it continues to grow and can
eventually drive vigorous convection.

The simulations depicted above are idealized and are only intended to

<h2 id="sec:g2">Gas Clouds in the Galactic Center</h2>
<div class="section">

<h4>Disruption by shear instabilities</h4>

<p>
There&rsquo;s a gas cloud (&ldquo;G2&rdquo;) in the galactic center
which has received lots of attention lately because its radial orbit
brings it close to the black hole in the center of our galaxy.
Several research groups have modeled this cloud using hydrodynamic
simulations, which don&rsquo;t include the effect of magnetic fields.
These studies consistently find that the cloud quickly breaks apart as
it moves through the background gas in the galactic center. This
result can only be reconciled with observations if G2 formed quite
recently, or if there is less gas in the galactic center than we
expected.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1409.6719M">I
showed</a> that magnetic fields can significantly slow the disruption
of gas clouds like G2, enabling them to live longer than was found in
earlier simulations. The figure below compares a hydro simulation
(right) with an MHD simulation (left). While the cloud completely
disintegrates in the hydro simulation, it stays intact when I include
magnetic fields. This result could relieve some of the tension between
our theories of the galactic center and simulations of G2.

<h4>Using G2 to probe the galactic center accretion flow</h4>

<p>
  Much of the excitement about G2 stems from the idea that part of it
  will fall into the black hole, causing an energetic outburst.  But
  equally exciting is the opportunity to use the gas cloud to learn
  about the dynamics in the galactic center: several theories predict
  different properties for the accretion flow feeding the black hole,
  but there&rsquo;s currently no observational test to determine which
  one is right.
</p>

<p>
  One result from our MHD simulations (see the previous section) is
  that magnetic fields can significantly amplify the drag force acting
  on gas clouds like G2.  This is an interesting possibility because
  there&rsquo;s a similar cloud in the galactic center
  (&ldquo;G1&rdquo;) which is on almost exactly the same orbit, but
  with less energy.  An
  interesting <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...798..111P">paper</a>
  by Oliver Pfuhl suggested that, if G1 and G2 started out along the
  same orbit, the lower energy for G1 could be the result of a drag
  force slowing it down.
</p>

<p>
  Ann-Marie Madigan and I further explored this possibility.  We found
  that, by modeling G2&rsquo;s orbit in detail, we can begin to
  constrain properties of the gas in the galactic center and to test
  the various theories for it.  Though it&rsquo;s a bit speculative,
  we hope this will be a useful result!
</p>

<p>
  The figure below shows a few different views of our model for
  G2&rsquo;s orbit.  The gas cloud initially comes in from apocenter
  on a nearly radial orbit.  The cloud&rsquo;s orbital plane is
  misaligned with the rotation of the background flow; in addition to
  slowing the cloud down, the drag force twists its orbital plane.
  After about five pericenter passages, the orbital plane is aligned
  with the rotation axis of the accretion flow.  No further twisting
  occurs, but the orbit circularizes and the cloud becomes
  approximately co-moving with the rotating gas.

       style="background:white;border:5px solid #eee8d5;"
       class="pad center">
</a>

<p>
  I&rsquo;ll admit that the orbit above looks slightly crazy, so I
  want to emphasize that it <i>is</i> in fact consistent with the
  observations.  The plot below shows the trajectory of the cloud in
  the plane of the sky, along with the astrometric measurements for G1
  and G2.  I also show the line-of-sight velocities determined from
  spectroscopy of the Br-γ line.  <i>This model does just as well as
  fitting G1 and G2 with two unrelated Keplerian orbits.</i>

       height="273"
       class="pad center">
</a>

<p>
  We&rsquo;re almost to the point where we can use this analysis to
  test theories for black hole accretion.  Below I show probability
  distributions for six parameters in the model: the angular
  coordinates for the rotation axis of the accretion flow, the
  magnetic field strength and density profile for the gas in the
  galactic center, the shape of the cloud, and the rotation profile
  for the galactic center.  Already, we constrain the rotation axis
  quite closely, and this prediction will be tested in the next year
  by the Event Horizon Telescope.
</p>

<p>
  The other parameters in our model are unfortunately still
  degenerate.  For example, the magnetic field strength and the
  density profile both control the magnitude of the drag force; since
  the cloud cares only about the total strength of the drag force, we
  can&rsquo;t determine the density or magnetic field strength
  individually.  However, measuring the magnetic field strength by
  some other means would yield a constraint on the density profile
  &mdash; that would provide a quantitative test for theories of the
  accretion flow feeding the black hole in our galactic center.
  Similarly, measuring the shape of the cloud would yield a constraint
  on the rotation profile for the galactic center accretion flow
  &mdash; both are very exciting prospects, and Ann-Marie and I are
  continuing to explore them!

       height="170"
       class="pad top right">
</a>
In a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02760">new paper</a>, we
update this model to account for precession inferred in the data.
This effect is best seen in &omega;, the argument of pericenter.  In
the figure to the right, I plot the ranges of &omega; evolution
predicted by our old models (yellow), and updated models (blue).  The
black error bars show estimates derived from the data we try to fit.
It's a subtle effect, but we see definite improvement!
</p>

<p>
Physically, precession (or an increase in the argument of pericenter
&omega;) corresponds to delaying cloud&rsquo;s closest approach to the
black hole.  The plot below summarizes our finding&hellip; we find that the
cloud passed the black hole in late summer of 2014, roughly 5 months
after previous predictions!  <i> This delay is so significant that the
pericenter passage probably happened after most of the observing
campaigns monitoring G2 ended.</i>  Intriguingly,
a <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.454.1525P">recent
    paper</a> found that the black hole began flaring significantly in
August of 2014.  Though any connection between G2 and activity at the
event horizon seems uncertain, it's hard to ignore that this
corresponds exactly with our favored pericenter passage.

<h2 id="sec:ti">Cold Gas in Hot Halos</h2>
<div class="section">

<p>
Remarkably, some galaxy clusters contain thin filaments of cold
(10<sup>4</sup> K) gas embedded right within the hot (10<sup>8</sup>
K) plasma.  Below, the beautiful optical and x-ray images
from <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.418.2154F">Fabian
et al. (2011)</a> show the co-existence of these two phases of gas.

<p>
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.419.3319M">I&rsquo;ve
studied</a> thermal instability in galaxy clusters and argued that it
can produce filaments of cold gas like the ones observed.  Whether or
not the plasma in clusters is thermally unstable is a surprisingly
tricky question --- it depends on the unknown &ldquo;feedback&rdquo;
process heating the plasma, which is difficult to model in detail and
is still a very active field of research.  My approach was
to <i>assume</i> that the gas is thermally unstable, then to see what
other testable implications that would have for the gas in galaxy
clusters.
</p>

<h4> When do we get cold gas? </h4>
<p>
Even though I assumed that <i>all</i> of the plasma in <i>every</i>
cluster is thermally unstable, it turns out that the instability only
grows to large amplitudes at special locations in the cluster.  We
should only expect to see cold gas develop at locations where the
cooling time drops below the free-fall (or dynamical) time.  The plot
below shows this result for various assumptions about the gas.  In all
cases, we only see clumps or filaments of cold gas when the cooling
time is shorter than the free-fall time.
</p>

     class="pad top bottom right">
</a>
Though this result depends on the non-linear saturation of the thermal
instability, we got lucky and it&rsquo;s surprisingly simple to
understand.  The plot to the right tracks the growth of the
instability in my simulations.  Perturbations initially grow
exponentially, which is not surprising since I put in an instability
by hand.  (The slower growth for the red curve happens because the
instability switches to an overstability in that limit.)  The
exponential growth can&rsquo;t continue forever, however; it stops
when the damping rate due to internal gravity wave turbulence matches
the driving rate due to thermal instability.  This balance picks out a
final amplitude δρ/ρ~(t<sub>cool</sub>/t<sub>ff</sub>)<sup>-1</sup>.
Multi-phase gas requires δρ/ρ>1, which explains why we only see it
when t<sub>cool</sub> drops below t<sub>ff</sub>.
</p>

<h4> What can thermal instability do for you? </h4>
<p>
The figure below plots the ratio t<sub>cool</sub>/t<sub>ff</sub> as a
function of radius in a handful of galaxy clusters.  The ones shown in
blue are clusters which are known to have filaments of cold gas, while
the ones shown in red are known <i>not</i> to contain filaments.
There does seem to be a threshold in t<sub>cool</sub>/t<sub>ff</sub>
separating the clusters with and without multiphase gas.
Interestingly, the curves all reach a minimum at a few tens of
kiloparsecs; this is exactly where we see cold gas seen in many
clusters!

<p>
This has implications for galaxy clusters and galaxy formation beyond
identifying where the cold gas comes from.  In
a <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.427.1219S">paper</a>
with Prateek Sharma, we argued that, since filaments of cold gas can
rapidly heat the remaining gas by fueling star formation and black
hole feedback, the gas in massive galaxies and galaxy clusters should
self-regulate to sit near the threshold for nonlinear thermal
instability.  In a
recent <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...799L...1V">series</a>
of <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1409.1598V">papers</a>,
Mark Voit and his collaborators have extended this theory and applied
it to a range of observations in galaxy and cluster formation.

<h2 id="sec:outer-parts">Why Aren&rsquo;t Galaxy Clusters Isothermal?</h2>
<div class="section">

<p>
Somehow, galaxy clusters maintain their large-scale temperature
gradients in spite of thermal conduction and convection.  Conduction
and convection are enemies of temperature differences&hellip; they should
only take a few billion years (less than the age of a typical cluster)
to equilibrate and make the gas isothermal.  But for some reason,
clusters aren&rsquo;t becoming isothermal.  Since the convective
stability of cluster gas depends on its temperature profile, I became
very interested in this conundrum.

</a>
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.432..404M">I put
together</a> a simple model for the formation of galaxy clusters in
which the cluster assembles &ldquo;shell-by-shell.&rdquo; As the
cluster grows in mass, each shell falls in a little faster than the
last, and thus shocks to a higher entropy.  Hydrostatic equilibrium
then determines the temperature profile, which depends directly on the
accretion rate of the cluster.  The accretion rates typical for galaxy
clusters turn out to yield declining temperature profiles, similar to
what are observed.  Measuring the properties of the gas in clusters
may thus provide an interesting indirect measurement of the formation
histories of clusters.
</p>

<p>
This model neatly reproduces the observed temperature profiles of
galaxy clusters, but what about conduction and convection?  Why
don&rsquo;t they wash out the temperature differences and make the gas
isothermal?  Conduction does indeed move thermal energy outwards in
galaxy clusters.  But, rather than heating the gas in the outskirts up
to higher temperatures, the influx of thermal energy <i>expands</i>
the gas &mdash; this pushes the shock further out and causes the
temperature to actually go down!  The overall effect is to keep the
temperature gradient approximately constant.
</p>

<h4>What's next?</h4>

<p>
This method provides an inexpensive way to model the temperature
profile of a galaxy cluster given its accretion history.  Since the
scatter in accretion histories is well-known from cosmological
simulations of structure formation, I outlined a method for using the
(known) scatter in accretion histories to predict the (unknown)
scatter in cluster observables at fixed mass.  For example, the figure
below shows that variation in accretion histories leads to about a 10%
scatter in temperature at fixed mass.  My collaborators and I are
currently using this method to better understand potential biases in
some cosmological measurements.

<h2 id="sec:bent-lobes">Spitting into the Wind</h2>
<div class="section">

<p>
The filaments I mentioned <a href="#sec:ti">above</a> are a lot like
star-forming clouds, but they don&rsquo;t live in galaxies.  Some
friends and I submitted an observing proposal to study star formation
in these filaments and compare it to star formation in molecular
clouds in galaxies.  While writing that proposal,
we <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.442..838M">serendipitously
discovered</a> a bent radio jet in one of the galaxies in the Perseus
cluster, pictured below.
</p>

     alt="hbi nonlinear evolution"

<p>
The jet is a beam of energetic particles launched by the super-massive
black hole in the center of the galaxy.  In this galaxy, the jet is
being bent backwards by the headwind the galaxy feels as it flies
through the plasma filling the galaxy cluster in which it lives.
</p>

<p>
We weren&rsquo;t the first to observe this phenomenon; in fact,
it&rsquo;s so well known that it&rsquo;s been used to discover new
galaxy clusters in radio surveys.  <i>However</i>, our
galaxy <i>is</i> the most extreme one known to date.  This jet&rsquo;s
bending is so severe that its radius of curvature is much smaller than
the size of the galaxy.  This implies that the &ldquo;wind&rdquo; of
intracluster plasma penetrates so deep into the center of the galaxy
that it affects star formation in the galaxy and even the dynamics of
its central black hole!  The galaxy is totally changed due to the fact
that it&rsquo;s inside a galaxy cluster.
</p>

<p>
Because we know how strong a headwind this galaxy feels, we can model
the dynamics of the jet in a little bit of detail.  We found that the
standard assumption of equipartition often used in interpreting other
jets underestimates the pressure in this one by a factor of almost 30.

<h2 id="sec:kelvin">Mixing and the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability</h2>
<div class="section">

<p>
A funny (and at first surprising) prediction of the fluid dynamics
equations is that it&rsquo;s impossible to <i>mix</i> different
fluids.  True mixing is caused by molecular diffusion, which
isn&rsquo;t included in the fluid equations.  From a fluid dynamics
standpoint, when you stir cream into your coffee, all you&rsquo;re
doing is folding and stretching the different layers of fluid into
thinner and thinner sheets&hellip; once the sheets get microscopically
thin, the fluid equations break down, diffusion takes over, and you
finally mix the two liquids.  <!-- Most astrophysics simulations
don&rsquo;t account for this molecular diffusion, however; any mixing
which occurs in these simulations represents errors accrued by
approximations in the code. -->
</p>

<p>
The <i>Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability</i> is a fluid dynamics
instability which rapidly rolls up sheets of fluid, accelerating this
folding-and-stretching process.  This instability is an important
process in fluid dynamics, and it crops up almost everywhere you look:
in meteorology, oceanography, engineering, and astrophysics.
It&rsquo;s definitely something we want to make sure we can simulate
accurately.

<p>
High-resolution simulations of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability
develop a beautiful, almost fractal-like structure of swirls within
swirls.  The small-scale swirls accelerate mixing and play a role in
the development of turbulence.  Scientists highlight this effect to
showcase their new codes, assuming fine features signal a
high-fidelity numerical solution&hellip; The only problem is that many
of these features may not be real!
</p>

<p>
An important feature of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability shown above
is that it doesn't converge: there is no well-defined
&ldquo;answer&rdquo; that a code should reproduce, and simulations
with increasing resolution find increasingly discrepant solutions with
more and more swirls.  At a glance, you can look at a simulation and
guess how modern (and how expensive) it was.
</p>

<p>
In a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03630">collaborative paper</a>
with Daniel Lecoanet and Ryan O&rsquo;Leary, we study a modified
version of the instability.  We carefully designed the problem so
it <i>does</i> have a well-defined answer and then we set out to find
it.  We show that low-resolution, inaccurate solutions produce
small-scale &ldquo;swirl-within-swirl&rdquo; features like I showed
above.  But they disappear with increasing resolution, and are totally
absent in the true solution!  The figure below shows the features
disappearing as we push to higher resolution and to more accurate
solutions:

At least in case we studied, we know these small-scale swirls
aren&rsquo;t real&hellip; they represent an artificial instability
introduced by approximations made in the code.  But we did modify the
problem slightly so that it has a well-defined answer.  Perhaps the
small-scale features <i>are</i> a correct feature of the original
problem?

It&rsquo;s a little tricky to answer that question.  Since the
unmodified problem doesn&rsquo;t have a solution, we can&rsquo;t say
how close we are to that solution.  So I&rsquo;m not convinced
it&rsquo;s meaningful to discuss what&rsquo;s real in the old problem.
</p>

<p>
We do, however, present a few lines of evidence that what we did is
more likely to be physically meaningful.  One is shown in the two
simulations to the left.  This compares one of our new simulations
(<i>left column</i>) with a very high-resolution simulation without
any diffusion (<i>right column</i>).  Time increases as you move down
the columns.
</p>

<p>
In the first image in this section, I showed that simulations with no
dissipation produce an intricate, &ldquo;swirl-within-swirl&rdquo;
structure.  When we push to absurdly high resolution, as shown in the
right column, we&rsquo;d naively expect to find <i>very</i> accurate
solutions, with very little mixing.  Instead, we find tons of tiny
instabilities which grow incredibly quickly and shred apart the main
vortex.  These instabilities are numerical in origin, and no matter
how big we make our simulation the instabilities grow in the smallest
scales available, which cannot be calculated accurately by the code.
</p>

<p>
This is perhaps the most unexpected result from our work: we show
that <i>including diffusion</i> in our simulations provides a very
effective way to <i>reduce</i> reduce mixing in astrophysical
simulations.  Even if the diffusion we add is unrealistically large
due to computational constraints, it&rsquo;s worse to add none at all.
Predictable mixing we intentionally put into our simulations is better
than the unpredictable (and very often violent) mixing due to numeric
errors in the method.
</p>

<p>
Diffusion is funny in fluid dynamics, though, and even a vanishingly
small amount of dissipation leads to different results than none at
all.  This has come up more than once in
well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Alembert%27s_paradox">paradoxes</a>
in fluid dynamics.
</p>

<p>
These features are beautiful, though&hellip; if they're not real,
it&rsquo;s kind of a shame.
